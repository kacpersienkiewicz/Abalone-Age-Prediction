# Abalone-Age-Prediction

Data Sourced from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone 

This is meant to use a Machine Learning algorithm to accurately predict the age of an abalone. First there will be an analysis of the features. This includes their distributions, correlations, and the make up of each variable.

This will be using a bunch of linear models and random forest models to attempt to predict the ages of the abalones.
